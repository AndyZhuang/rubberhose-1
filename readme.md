# rubberhose

Inspired from the original rubberhose software of Julian Assange â€” A simple symmetric cryptosystem with the feature to create a self-distructing message, identified by the hash of the cyphertext. A deniable encryption system whose existence can only be verified using the appropriate cryptographic key. [[online_version](http://rubberhose.andrealeone.xyz)]<br>
